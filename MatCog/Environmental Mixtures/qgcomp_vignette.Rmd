Basic model of g-computation: 
 $$\mathbb{E}(Y^{\mathbf{X}_q} | \mathbf{Z,\psi,\eta}) = g(\psi_0 + \psi_1 S_q + \mathbf{\eta Z})$$
 - $g(\cdot)$: link function in GLM
 - $\psi_0$: model intercept
 - $\eta$: model coefficients for covariates 
 - $S_q$: index of joint value of exposures (all exposures being set to the same value)
 - $\mathbf{X}_q$: categorical bin of exposure
 - $\psi_1$: expected change in the outcome given a one quantile increase in all exposures simultaneously (overall mixture effect)
 
 
 $$[ \mathbb{E}(Y | \mathbf{X,\beta}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_3 ]$$
 - $\psi_1$ will equal the sum of the $\beta$ coefficients
